# Kai's Wallflower NPC Rebake LCP
A project to LCP-ify the playtest versions of Kai's Wallflower NPC rebakes. For more info, please search the Pilot.net Discord for his pdfs.
# Check releases for the lcp file.
### To compile the lcp manually:
- Select contents of the "Wallflower Rebakes" folder. *Do not select the folder itself*.
- Right click and select "Add to "folder-name.zip"

  - Similar instructions will work for other non-Winrar compression programs
- Note that versioning will likely be broken for self compiled ones.
